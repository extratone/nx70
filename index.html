A waterproof performance rating of IPx4 means that the main camera body is protected against rain showers and water splashes.</BR><BR>A waterproof performance rating of IPx4 means that the main camera body is protected against rain showers and water splashes. However, it should not be submerged underwater or sprayed with pressurised water from a tap or hose. When used with accessories such as an external microphone, a rain cover should be used to protect the accessory and connection.

journalists, documentary makers and anyone else who needs capture superb content whatever the conditions, the dust and rain-proof HXR-NX70 is the perfect compact camcorder.\u003C\u002FBR\u003E\u003CBR\u003EIn low light conditions, its Exmor R™ CMOS sensor delivers roughly double the sensitivity of conventional CMOS sensors, while an ultra-wide angle 26.3mm Sony G Lens™ lets you capture more of the action in close shooting situations. You can also ‘geo-tag’ your precise location with built-in GPS, while 96 Gigabytes of embedded Flash Memory provides up to 40 hours of storage capacity - ideal when operating in remote locations.\u003C\u002FBR\u003E\u003CBR\u003EThe exceptionally robust NX70 doesn’t sacrifice picture quality however, with CinemaTone technology providing deeper, more film-like skin tones. And if you want precise, hands-on control there’s a switchable lens ring for manual control of focus, iris and zoom functions. \u003C\u002FBR\u003E\u003CBR\u003E\nThe HXR-NX70 is suitable for producing content for international usage thanks to the latest 50p recording options.

The camcorder’s sealed body design makes sure that harmful sand and large dust particles do not get inside. A waterproof performance rating of IPx4 means that the main camera body is protected against rain showers and water splashes.\u003C\u002FBR\u003E\u003CBR\u003EA waterproof performance rating of IPx4 means that the main camera body is protected against rain showers and water splashes. However, it should not be submerged underwater or sprayed with pressurised water from a tap or hose. When used with accessories such as an external microphone, a rain cover should be used to protect the accessory and connection. IP5x rating does not guarantee 100% protection against exposure to extremely fine particles."},{"statement":"Ultra-wide Angle 26.3mm G lens","benefit":"Engineered for superior optical performance, Sony G lenses deliver brilliant, accurate colour reproduction and sharp, amazingly detailed images. In addition, the 26.3mm focal length offers a broader perspective than previous lenses for enhanced wide angle shooting so you can capture more of the scene when close in."},{"statement":"Assignable Lens Ring (Focus\u002FZoom\u002FIris)","benefit":"Get the most out of your camcorder with enhanced manual controls. The assignable lens ring allows for manual adjustment of focus, iris, and zoom settings so you have complete creative control."},{"statement":"Optical SteadyShot image stabilisation with Active Mode","benefit":"Optical SteadyShot image stabilisation with Active Mode provides superior compensation for camera shake to deliver stunningly smooth video from wide angle to full telephoto shooting. In addition, the innovative 3-Way Shake-Cancelling feature adds electronic roll stability for even smoother video capture."},{"statement":"Back-illuminated Exmor R CMOS sensor for superb low-light video","benefit":"Journalists rarely shoot under studio lighting conditions and Sony’s back-illuminated Exmor R™ CMOS sensor delivers stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. Designed for compact cameras and camcorders, the Exmor R™ sensor relocates the photo diodes above the support circuitry, maximising the light gathering area per pixel so you can shoot with better results in low-light conditions. The sensitivity is roughly double that of conventional CMOS sensors of the same size and pixel size."},{"statement":"1920 x 1080 Full HD 60p Recording with 12.3 Mega pixels still image capture","benefit":"The compact HXR-NX70 shoots in Full High Definition quality (1920 x 1080) with a choice of 60p, 60i, 30p and 24p frame rates. It can also simultaneously shoot 12.3 Mega Pixel (4672 x 2628) still images (Note: Dual Rec is not active when recording mode is set to FX or PS.) It also supports playback via HDMI and compatible HDTV, for complete flexibility in reviewing your footage."},{"statement":"96GB* embedded Flash Memory for up to 40 hours of HD recording","benefit":"Built-in Flash memory provides extra capacity, ideal when working remotely, as well as providing additional workflow options for back-up and sharing content. 96GB embedded Flash memory can record and store up to 40 hours of high definition video footage in HD LP mode.\u003C\u002FBR\u003E\u003CBR\u003E\n* 96GB equals 96 billion bytes.

Two balanced XLR audio inputs are built in with phantom power and attenuation options that professional shooters require for clean sound quality. Default audio settings for XLR recording are highlighted in green for easy reference in the field in order to reduce operator error under difficult lighting conditions.\u003C\u002FBR\u003E\u003CBR\u003EThe ECM-XM1 shotgun microphone mounted on top of the handle provides audio recording performance similar to larger shoulder-mounted ENG style cameras."},{"statement":"Geotagging with built-in GPS receiver","benefit":"A built-in GPS receiver makes the HXR-NX70 an ideal choice for professional videographers. The receiver gives you the ability to “geo-tag” shooting locations - making it easy if you need to return to the same location or to create a log when surveying remote locations. Your locations can be tracked on Google maps and all GPS data can be extracted with a PC.\u003C\u002FBR\u003E\u003CBR\u003EAdditionally, the receiver automatically adjusts your camcorder’s clock to the proper time zone when international travel is part of your assignment."},{"statement":"Direct Copy to external HDD without PC","benefit":"Store content or backup important shots by copying footage directly from your camcorder to an external hard disk drive (sold separately) without using a computer.
